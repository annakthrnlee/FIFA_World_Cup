# FIFA_World_Cup

### Week 2 overview:

This weeks role was to create Three visualizations to help our viewers better understand the data. Using Tableau I was able to create just that. Like any project one is bound to run into road blocks. Unfortunely, my previous data was lost and was uncessessful in recovering most my data. With that I did have to start from the beginning and also reached out to Anna Lee for assistance regarding visualizaiton and brain storm ideas that fit the project.
