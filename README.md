# FIFA_World_Cup

### First Segment: Sketch It Out 
#### My Roles:
- üîº Triangle: The member in the triangle role will create a mockup of a machine learning model. This can even be a diagram that explains how it will work concurrently with the rest of the project steps.
- ‚èπ Square: The team member in the square role will be responsible for the repository.

### Rubric For This Week:

#### Presentation: 
- Selected topic: 2022 FIFA World Cup Predictions 

- Reason for selected topic: The FIFA World Cup is the most prestigious football tournament in the world. The championship has been awarded every four years since the start of the tournament in 1930. The matches take place towards the end of November, thus we found this topic to be relevant given the timeframe and popular for those who follow soccor. 

- Description of the source of data: The data sources are obtained through CSV files. Each file is well structured and has enough columns and categories to easily filter for specific topics we intend to use. The datasets are also updated (last update 28-08-22) providing us with the ability accommodate recent scores. The dataset provides a complete overview of all international soccer matches played since the 90s. On top of that, the strength of each team is provided by incorporating actual FIFA rankings as well as player strengths based on the EA Sport FIFA video game.

- Questions we hope to answer with the data: Using our knowldge of machine learning and data analysis, can we create a model that allows users to predict the 2022 FIFA World Cup winner based on past information. 

#### GitHub Repository ‚èπ
- Description of the communication protocols: 

- At least one branch for each team member: (still waiting for Stephanee to add her section). I'm taking over Emma's portion since she's out of town this week but she will still need to create her branchs per instructions. 

- Each team member has at least four commits for the duration of the first segment: 

#### Machine Learning Model: üîº
- Which model did I choose and why?
For starters, I found it best to go with a supervised machine learning model because it deals with labeled data. Supervised learning is a great option when it comes to predictions, since our goal as a team is to create create a model that allows users to predict the 2022 FIFA World Cup winner based on past information, supervised learning makes the most sense. Supervised learning takes two forms, regression, and classification. I chose to work with classification because it's best used to predict discrete outcomes and is used to identify the category of new observations based on training data.
Thus, our machine learning model will learn from our given datasets and classify new observations into several classes or groups (predicted winners based on each observation).

- How am I training the model?
Multiple questions will need to be addressed before training the model. First, I'll need to look over both datasets and decide which columns (categories) are most fit to help predict my final goal outcome. The first dataset (International_Matches.csv) has 25 columns, however, 8 columns appear empty so I will first delete the unnecessary values because they serve no true purpose in my results. I will evaluate the remaining columns and decide which will be necessary for the model's final predictions and which can be set aside. 

I have dropped all columns that serve no purpose and set aside a portion of our dataset to evaluate my model. Please see Revised_International_Matches.csv

- What is the model's accuracy?

- How does this model work?
