# FIFA_World_Cup

### Project Goals (ROAD MAP): Reminder as we move forward each week

- First Segment: Sketch It Out: Decide on your overall project, select your question, and build a simple model. You'll connect the model to a fabricated database, using comma-separated values (CSV) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files, to prototype your idea.

- Second Segment: Build the Pieces: Train your model and build out the database you'll use for your final presentation.

- Third Segment: Plug It In: Connect your final database to your model, continue to train your model, and create your dashboard and presentation.

- Fourth Segment: Put It All Together: Put the final touches on your model, database, and dashboard. Lastly, create and deliver your final presentation to  your class.

### Rubric For This Week: WEEK 1

#### Presentation: 
- Selected topic: 2022 FIFA World Cup Predictions 

- Reason for selected topic: The FIFA World Cup is the most prestigious football tournament in the world. The championship has been awarded every four years since the start of the tournament in 1930. The matches take place towards the end of November, thus we found this topic to be relevant given the timeframe and popular for those who follow soccor. 

- Description of the source of data: The data sources are obtained through CSV files. Each file is well structured and has enough columns and categories to easily filter for specific topics we intend to use. The datasets are also updated (last update 28-08-22) providing us with the ability accommodate recent scores. The dataset provides a complete overview of all international soccer matches played since the 90s. On top of that, the strength of each team is provided by incorporating actual FIFA rankings as well as player strengths based on the EA Sport FIFA video game.

- Questions we hope to answer with the data: Using our knowldge of machine learning and data analysis, can we create a model that allows users to predict the 2022 FIFA World Cup winner based on past information.
