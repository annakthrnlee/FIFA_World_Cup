- Using Tableau create a few visualizations to help our viewers better understand the data. EX: create a pie chart that displays all the wins for home and away teams, this way it's easy to see the differences between the amount won and lost for both categories.

- Create ATLEAST three visualizations. This will be added to the Google Slides presentation once completed.
