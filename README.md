### Rubric For This Week:
#### Technologies Integrated Throughout Project: X
    -	Which tools are the best fit for your project?

For this project, my group and I discussed what possible tools to use that could help us with our outcome on our question regarding FIFA World Cup. Our goal as a team is to create a model that allows users to predict the 2022 FIFA World Cup winner based on past information. 

Anna Lee will be using a supervised machine learning model because it deals with labeled data and will help with the data we have chosen to use on our project. With Supervised learning, there are two forms, regression, and classification. She will be using classification because it's best used to predict discrete outcomes and is used to identify the category of new observations based on training data. 

    - What technologies will be used for each section? 

A few technologies that will be used is Python, Panda, SQLAlchemy, and aws-machine learning

    - How will the dashboard be built?

Our dashboard will be built through Justinmind.
