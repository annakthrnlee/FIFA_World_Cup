# FIFA_World_Cup

I created three visualizations to show the difference between 2022 players and their height, age, and weight depending on their country. 
Findings:
- Brazil has the lowest average height for their 2022 players / Denmark has the highest average height for their players.
- England has the lowest average age for their 2022 players / Turkey and Iceland are tied for having the highest average age for their players.
- Argentina has the lowest average weight for their 2022 players / Denmark has the highest average weight for their players.

One factor to acknowledge: 
- Even though there are differences when it comes to the player's attributes (height/weight/age), we don't see very much change when you compare birth year (dob) with height and weight. The only differences occur when you compare the same attributes with the player's country.
