## Data Cleaning and Analysis

Python will be used to further the data analysis, while Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. 
SQLAlchemy for importing into Postgres and pulling out of Postgres.

## Database Storage

Each team member will be using their own branch to store their information. personally using python to store and git clone my work. There is a lot of data that are already in a csv file so just cleaning and narrowing down to what we are trying to answer for our project.  

## Machine Learning 

Within the project supervised machine learning model because it deals with labeled data and will help with the data we have chosen to use on our project. With Supervised learning, there are two forms, regression, and classification. In the project my team will be using classification because it's best used to predict discrete outcomes and is used to identify the category of new observations based on training data.

## Dashboard

My team and I will most likely be using Justinmind to built a fully functioning dashboard.
